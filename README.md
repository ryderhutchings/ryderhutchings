### About Me
**Hey there! I'm Ryder Hutchings, 16 years old, and just figuring out this whole "README" thing.**

I'm into **Mountain Biking**, **FPV Flying**, and basically all things technology-related, currently coding with **Python** and **HTML/CSS**. I also have a small background in several other languages like **C**.

- Navigating high school, and trying to make the most of life.
- Oh, and currently unemployed, but always on the lookout for new opportunities.

### Projects

- I'm building myself a Personal Assistant AI. <br>
**Note**: It's not easy, but it's fun!

- More projects will be coming soon!
